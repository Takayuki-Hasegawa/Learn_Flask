# This is a repository for my personal study of Flask.

## Why??
I've been developing with Django for work, but Flask seemed to be a better fit for small to medium scale development.

## Future plans

The purpose of this repository is to learn Flask from scratch.
I don't plan to release any significant backend here.
In the future, my goal is to develop backend modules for machine learning and AI to publish on the web.
